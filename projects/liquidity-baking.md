Sirius ($SIRS) is a token that lets you automatically participate in Liquidity Baking, a decentralized liquidity pool between tez and tzBTC that is incentivized at the protocol level on the Tezos blockchain.

Liquidity Baking is a decentralized solution relying on automated market making (AMM), where an algorithm provides price quotes to the end user according to a predefined rule set. Anyone can join as a liquidity provider by buying the $SIRS token, or by acquiring an equal amount of two tokens (in terms of value) and adding them to the liquidity pool.
