Block Born is a Misfits Gaming Group initiative to bring Tier 1 e-sports infrastructure to the grassroots community of blockchain gamers on Tezos. Block Born is first and foremost a launchpad for game developers to find backers to support project development at all stages. Our goal is to help foster new and exciting games that focus on engaging gameplay first and blockchain technology second. Outside of the launchpad, Block Born will host a slew of tournaments, events, and create engaging content to promote existing projects and bring community members together.
