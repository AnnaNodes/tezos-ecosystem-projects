Yupana.Finance is an open-source, decentralized, and non-custodial liquidity protocol from Madfish Solutions, built to securely lend and borrow digital assets via smart contracts. Yupana provides the Tezos community with the benefits of decentralized financial features and tools. Depositors provide liquidity in the protocol, receiving passive income, while borrowers take overcollateralized loans.
