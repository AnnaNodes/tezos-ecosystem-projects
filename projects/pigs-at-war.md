Pigs at War is a Strategy and Action Game built on Tezos Blockchain. Similar to titles like Clash of Clans or Command & Conquer and Fallout Shelter, the game experience consists of land and resource management together with battle features tied to the PaW Tezos based Marketplace where assets can be traded through a variety of user and between-user interactions. Not only NFTs can be traded there. Also Resources can be managed and even full farms can be rented out to other youmans/players.
